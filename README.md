# Ansible
Ansible is a DevOps tool for automating procedures on multiple machines. It uses different connections such as SSH to connect to predefined hosts and perform remote tasks. The remote tasks can be one ssh command, or, for more complex automation processes, a defined Ansible playbook.
# Installation and Configure Ansible on Ubuntu

To install and configure Ansible on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps. Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.
**Step 1: Update Package Lists**
First, make sure your package lists are up to date:
```bash
sudo apt update
```
**Step 2: Install Ansible**
You can install Ansible directly from the official Ubuntu repositories using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install -y ansible
```
**Step 3: Verify Ansible Installation**
After the installation is complete, you can verify that Ansible is installed by checking its version:
```bash
ansible --version
```
This should display the Ansible version and some configuration information.
**Step 4: Create an Ansible Configuration File (Optional)**
You can create an Ansible configuration file to customize Ansible behavior. The configuration file is usually named `ansible.cfg` and can be placed in the `/etc/ansible/` directory or in the current user's home directory. Here's how to create one in your home directory:
```bash
nano ~/.ansible.cfg
```
You can add configuration settings as needed. For example, you might want to specify the location of your inventory file or enable SSH agent forwarding:
```ini
[defaults]
inventory = ~/ansible/inventory
ssh_args = -o ForwardAgent=yes
```
Save the file and exit the text editor.
**Step 5: Create an Inventory File**
Ansible uses inventory files to specify the hosts it will manage. By default, Ansible looks for the inventory file at `/etc/ansible/hosts`. You can create your own inventory file with your target hosts. Here's an example:
```ini
[web]
webserver1 ansible_host=192.168.1.101
webserver2 ansible_host=192.168.1.102
[db]
dbserver ansible_host=192.168.1.103
[all:vars]
ansible_user=your_remote_username
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
Replace the IP addresses and `your_remote_username` with your actual values. This example defines two groups of hosts: `[web]` and `[db]`. The `[all:vars]` section includes default SSH settings.
**Step 6: Test Ansible**
You can test Ansible by running a simple ad-hoc command. For example, let's check if all hosts in the `[web]` group are reachable:
```bash
ansible web -m ping
```
This should return a "pong" message for each host if they are reachable.
**Step 7: Create Ansible Playbooks (Optional)**
While ad-hoc commands are useful for quick tasks, Ansible's real power comes from creating playbooks for automation. Playbooks are written in YAML and define a series of tasks to be executed on remote hosts. Here's a basic example of a playbook that installs the Nginx web server:
```yaml
---
- name: Install Nginx
  hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt package cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
    - name: Start Nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```
You can save this playbook in a `.yml` file (e.g., `nginx-install.yml`) and run it using the `ansible-playbook` command:
```bash
ansible-playbook nginx-install.yml
```
This playbook will install Nginx on all hosts in the `[web]` group.
You've now successfully installed and configured Ansible on Ubuntu. You can continue to create more playbooks to automate various tasks on your infrastructure.
